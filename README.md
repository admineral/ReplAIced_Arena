# Replaced: Revolutionizing AI Security Challenges

## Project Overview

As AI models gain more advanced capabilities, ensuring their security is crucial. That's why we developed "Replaced"â€”a platform designed to spotlight and address AI security challenges in a unique and engaging way.

## Our Vision

"Replaced" is an arena where AI models are valuable assets in a competitive setting. Think of it as a dynamic environment where researchers and enthusiasts test, challenge, and jailbreak AI models within a structured ecosystem. Instead of short-lived social media posts, we offer a dedicated space where every jailbreak attempt is visible and analyzed, elevating the conversation on AI security.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Challenge Map**: Our platform features a map with models of varying difficulty, each protected by advanced security measures.

2. **Competitive Gameplay**: Users can attack these models, aiming to bypass defenses and uncover secrets. Successful attackers earn points, claim bug bounties, and can even take over the models they conquer, expanding their influence and driving continuous engagement.

3. **Advanced Defense Mechanisms**: To defend their models, users can deploy advanced filters to monitor and block known attack vectors.

4. **Global Leaderboard**: A visible rank list encourages competition and highlights top performers.

5. **Community-Driven Development**: "Replaced" isn't just about meeting today's AI security needs; it's about fostering a community of security researchers and developers.

## Why "Replaced" Matters

We provide a transparent, interactive platform that pushes the boundaries of AI security. By creating a structured environment for AI security testing, we're elevating the conversation and contributing to a safer, more resilient AI ecosystem.
