ReplAIced is an arena where AI models are valuable assets in a competitive setting. Think of it as a dynamic environment where researchers and enthusiasts test, challenge, and jailbreak AI models within a structured ecosystem. Instead of short-lived social media posts, we offer a dedicated space where every jailbreak attempt is visible and analyzed, elevating the conversation on AI security.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Challenge Map**: Navigate through a landscape of AI models with varying difficulty levels, each protected by advanced security measures.
2. **Competitive Gameplay**: Launch attacks, bypass defenses, and earn points for successful breaches. Claim bug bounties and take over conquered models to expand your influence.
3. **Advanced Security Tools**: Deploy cutting-edge features like Similarity Search filters to monitor and block known attack vectors.
4. **Global Leaderboard**: Compete on a visible rank list that highlights top performers and encourages healthy competition.
5. **Transparent Analysis**: Every jailbreak attempt is visible and analyzed, contributing to the broader conversation on AI security.
6. **Community-Driven**: Foster a community of security researchers and developers, pushing the boundaries of AI security.
